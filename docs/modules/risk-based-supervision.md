# RBS (Risk Based Supervision) Module

The RBS Module in Athena Guard is designed to give you a clear picture of risk across various categories, helping you make informed decisions. The RBS Module includes key sections like the Master Sheet, Risk Parameter Sheet, and Dashboard Risk Drivers, each packed with features to simplify risk oversight.


## Master Sheet

The Master Sheet is the backbone of the RBS Module, offering a detailed overview of risk data across different departments and timeframes.
- Displays a table with columns such as Department, Risk Category Drivers, Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), Exposure, Applicability, Data Units, and financial data for multiple years (e.g., FY 2023-24, FY 2022-23, FY 2021-22, FY 2020-21, FY 2019-20).
- Allows filtering by department (e.g., All Departments) to focus on specific risk areas.
- Provides a "Save" button to store your entries and updates.


## Risk Parameter Sheet
The Risk Parameter Sheet dives deeper into the scoring process, focusing on two primary areas: Business Risk and Governance and Oversight.
- Assigns criticality scores (e.g., Lower is Better, Medium, High) and tracks data points over time (e.g., March 2023 to March 2024).
- Includes a "Fetch Data" button to pull in the latest risk parameters for analysis.



## Dashboards for Risk Drivers
The Dashboard Risk Drivers brings risk visualization to life with an interactive dashboard, offering insights into risk evolution and governance performance.

- Presents time series data of various risk drivers (e.g., Asset Quality and Credit Risk, Liquidity) in pie charts and line graphs.
- Includes a G&O (Governance and Oversight) tab with color-coded gauges (e.g., green for low risk, red for high risk) to show performance across key areas like Board and Senior Management.
- Allows filtering by risk categories (e.g., Risks-1, Risks-2) and toggling between RBS Table views.


## How to Use the Module
1. Master Sheet: Start here to review and save detailed risk data across departments and years.
2. Risk Parameter Sheet: Analyze specific risk parameters and trends to inform your strategy.
3. Dashboard Risk Drivers: Use the dashboard to visualize risk evolution and governance performance, adjusting filters as needed.
