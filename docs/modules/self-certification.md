# Self Certification

The Self Certification module in Athena Guard makes it easy for organizations to stay compliant with internal policies and external regulatory requirements. Tailored for simplicity and precision, this feature empowers designated users—especially Heads of Department (HODs)—to confidently certify the adherence to applicable laws and regulations through a structured and streamlined process.

## Key Features

### A Certificate Creation System
HODs hold the rights to create and submit certificates. These certificates serve as formal declarations of regulatory compliance for a selected financial cycle.
- The Self Cetification Page provides a ready made template with as cycle, financial year, applicable laws, and specific rules followed as editable fields to be Submitted by the HODs.
- Only the HOD can create, modify, and submit certificates—ensuring strict oversight and minimizing the risk of errors.
- This role-based control ensures the accuracy, authority, and integrity of every certificate generated.

### Centralized Certificate Repository
Once submitted, certificates are automatically stored in a central repository which is visible to Compliance Makers, Checkers, and other relevant stakeholders.

- Users with appropriate access can view certificates from previous cycles, making it easy to retrieve historical compliance records when needed.

### Download Certificates Capability
- Users can download certificates for internal audits and record keeping purposes


## Benefits

- **Role-specific control:** Only the HOD can initiate certificates, ensuring authority and accountability.
- **Time-saving:** Templates reduce manual effort and standardize content across teams.
- **Always audit-ready:** With every certificate stored in one place, audits become smooth and stress-free.



## Use Cases

- Periodic certification of compliance with RBI, SEBI, or internal governance guidelines.
- Streamlined documentation for internal and external audits.
- Organization-wide visibility into regulatory adherence.
